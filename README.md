# Online-Training-Schedule
This is Traning Schedule Online for your all training programs, all in one place! 
For this project i used **[ReactJS](https://bg.reactjs.org/)** for client and **[Express](https://expressjs.com/)** for backend and many smaller libraries.

The idea of the application is a Traning Schedule Online where after successful registration or login, you can see all about your friends and their personal training programs, create own training program, posts, you can share your training programs and posts for all or only for your friends, naturally we can't have an app without chat comunication, for that we have also a chat. We also have a calendar where you can set your events and to set up your schedule more easily!

**BONUS:** Mobile App support, You can upload images from your device, hosting, real life chat!
